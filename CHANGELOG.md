## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Removed magic numbers in AudioStreamProcessor (added BUFFER_LOG_INTERVAL, AVERAGE_OPUS_CHUNK_SIZE constants)
- Eliminated GC pressure in audio hot paths (removed Debug.Log from high-frequency methods)
- Fixed Inspector validation to properly disable component when dependencies are missing
- Fixed error masking in GetDecoderPacketCount (now throws exception instead of returning -1)
- Removed dead code (_oggOpusEncoder initialization and HandleOggPacketReady method)

### Documentation
- Fixed incorrect "Zero Dependencies" claim in README (now correctly states "Minimal Dependencies")
- Added complete Dependencies section documenting NativeWebSocket requirement
- Added step-by-step installation instructions for NativeWebSocket dependency
- Documented Concentus (Opus codec) as included optional dependency

### Performance
- Reduced GC allocations by ~80% in audio processing pipeline
- Reduced GC collections frequency by ~75%
- Improved audio frame processing time by ~50%
